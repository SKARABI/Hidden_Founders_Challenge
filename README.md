## Web Coding Challenge
This is a **web application website** that I am going to code it as a `Full Stack Web Application`, by describing the technologies and the tools that I am going to work with, also by reporting all the modification. Every step will be detailed with all the information.

## THE WEB FRAMEWORK THAT I AM GOING TO USE
