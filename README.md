# Hidden Founders Challenge
## Web Coding Challenge
This is a **web application website** that I am going to code it as a `Full Stack Web Application`, by describing the technologies and the tools that I am going to work with, also by reporting all the modification. Every step will be detailed with all the information.

## THE WEB FRAMEWORK THAT I AM GOING TO USE:
I am going to use the `Ruby on Rails`, I worked with many frameworks such as `Symfony` and `Laravel`, so I am going to switch to this technology for more exploration.
